# MyCanvas

Just a small application to enhance my understanding of certain technologies and libraries.  
React + Typescript + Redux-toolkit as a foundation, Styled-components for, well, styling, some unit tests with the help of the Jest, and, obviously, a lot of canvas fun.  
A fully responsive application with mobile first philosophy.
